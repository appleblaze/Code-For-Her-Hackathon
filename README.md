# Code-For-Her-Hackathon
Our submission for the theme of the hackathon - A forum for interaction among members of Aspire For Her.
It is the first hackathon for each member of the team. The team members are- Prachi Randeria, Gayatri Patil and Priyanka Hotchandani. 
We have built a website which consists of a blog and a discussion form. The blog can be accessed by any user while the forum can only be accessed by the members. The main page also gives the description of the non-profit organisation - Aspire For Her. 
The first page of the website can be accessed by index.php which displays various information about the organisation and has links to the blog and forum. The project won't fully run without the database files. These database files have been uploaded a little later than the actual submission time. Sorry for the inconvinience.
