# Code-For-Her-Hackathon
Our submission for the theme of the hackathon - A forum for interaction among members of Aspire For Her.
We have built a website which consists of a blog and a discussion form. The blog can be accessed by any user while the forum can only be accessed by the members. The main page also gives the description of the non-profit organisation - Aspire For Her. 
The first page of the website can be accessed by index.php which displays varios information about the organisation and has links to the blog and forum.
